The intention for fusion power is to generate energy. To this end, the spherical tokamak advanced reactor (STAR) uses a D-T reaction to generate high energy neutrons. 
D-T reactions have a mjr advantage over other fusion reactions in the fact that the neutron emitted has the highest energy amongst the other otions, at 14 Mev. However,
tritium has a relativly short half life of 12 years, which makes it difficult to acumulate and store for this reaction. To resolve this, lithium-6 is used with a neutron source
to produce both tritium and a low every neutron. This occurs within the blanket to provide a tritium soure for the D-T reaction. Once the D-T reaction occurs, the kinetic energy 
of the 14 MeV neutrons must be converted to a more useful energy form. Currently, the method of choice is moderation of the neutron by lead.

\bigskip

The primary focus of our work is optimizing the blanket's configuration to promote tritium production for the D-T reaction. A secondary focus is the development of the 
neutron shield to protect other component's and personel.
