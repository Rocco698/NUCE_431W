## The Project

With the intention for the spherical tokamak advanced reactor (STAR) to generate energy; It uses a D-T reaction to generate high-energy neutrons. 
However, there are multiple issues associated with the use of tritium in this reaction. The first is that tritium has a relatively short half-life of 2 years,
which makes it difficult to accumulate and store for this reaction. Second, the energy emitted in this reaction is mostly transferred to the emitted neutron,
leading to extremely high energy neutrons, 14 MeV. To resolve these issues, lithium-6 is used with a neutron source to produce both tritium and a small
number of neutrons. This occurs within the blanket, which contains the lithium-6 to breed tritium. Once the D-T reaction occurs, the kinetic energy of the 14
MeV neutrons must be converted to a more useful energy form. The current moderator of choice, within the blanket, is lead.
The primary focus of our work is optimizing the blanket's configuration to promote tritium production for this D-T reaction. The secondary focus is the
optimization of the neutron shield to protect other components and personnel.

## CAD_TO_OPENMC Workflow Guide

This guide aims to provide a clean and repeatable workflow for using the CAD_TO_OPENMC commands. The official documentation for CAD_TO_OPENMC can be found [here](https://github.com/united-neux/CAD_to_OpenMC).
